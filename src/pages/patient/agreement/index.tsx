                Therapy is a collaborative endeavour requiring both the
                Therapist and You to work together to achieve mutually agreed
                goals. To achieve these goals both the Therapist and You need to
                make a good-faith effort to engage in the Therapy process
                together. It is important that You talk with your Therapist if
                You have any concerns about the process, the direction of
                therapy or have any concerns about your well-being and safety.
